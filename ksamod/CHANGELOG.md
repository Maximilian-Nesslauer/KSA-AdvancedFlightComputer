## [0.2.0]

Updated compatability with new staging menu, added ascent overlay, tweaked landing parameters

- Ascent params moved into the main Ascent tab (no more separate popup), expanded
  by default alongside the target orbit.
- Added a map/world overlay for ascent: target orbit in cyan, flown trajectory in
  magenta. Toggleable, and hidden while the Landing tab is open.
- Stage table now shows delta-v per stage, and is visible before you hit EXECUTE
  so you can check your staging on the pad.
- Moved the G-FOLD-to-hover handoff setting into the Deorbit tab, next to the rest
  of the approach settings.
- Touchdown is now detected by actual ground contact instead of an altitude
  guess, for both G-FOLD descent and terminal hover — engines cut the instant any
  part of the vehicle touches down.
- Fixed: solid rocket boosters were treated as having no propellant, so their
  fuel and thrust were missing from the ascent stage list.
- Auto-staging now also drops burned-out boosters that are still attached to a
  live core, not just at total engine flameout — and won't ever separate the part
  of the vehicle you're actually flying.
- Fixed: disengaging the autopilot could leave the vehicle spinning uncontrollably,
  and could make the Strict/Balanced/Relaxed attitude presets stop responding.
